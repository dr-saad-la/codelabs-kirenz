# Installation of Anaconda, TensorFlow & TFX

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 0:02:00

We start with an overview of the software we will install in this tutorial: Anaconda, TensorFlow & TensorFlow Extended.

<aside class="positive">
We use the data science platform Anaconda to install TFX
</aside>

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
- [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines. When youâ€™re ready to move your models to production, use TFX to create and manage a production pipeline.
- We will use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) open source data science platform to install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Extended. Anaconda's package manager *Conda* makes it very easy to manage multiple data environments that can be maintained and run separately without interference from each other.

## Install Anaconda individual

Go to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and choose the appropriate `Graphical Installer` for your system (Windows, MacOS or Linux). Install the software on your system:

- [Installing on macOS](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
- [Installing on Windows](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/windows/)
- [https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux/](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux/) 

Here some tips if you have problems installing Anaconda: [troubleshooting](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/#anaconda-installer-download-problems).

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create TensorFlow environment

[Conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands
) help manage dependencies and isolate projects. This is particularly useful when some packages require specific Python versions (like TensorFlow).

On Windows open the Start menu and open an Anaconda Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux open a terminal window.

We create an environment with a specific version of Python (3.8). We call the environment ``tf``:

```bash
conda create -n tf python=3.8 
```

When conda asks you to proceed ``(proceed ([y]/n)?``), type ``y``.


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Activate TensorFlow environment
Duration: 00:02:00

You can activate your environment as follows:

```bash
conda activate tf
```

And deactivate it with:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Install TensorFlow Extended
Duration: 00:03:00

First of all, you have to activate the `tf` environment:

```bash
conda activate tf
```

Now we have to use `pip` (pip is the package installer for Python) to install TensorFlow and TFX in our `tf` environment:

You can delete `-cpu` if your machine supports GPU:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-cpu
```

```bash
pip install tfx
```
