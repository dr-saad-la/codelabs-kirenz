## Overview

Duration: 0:02:00

### What we cover

In this tutorial you learn how to install Kubeflow - a popular framework for running Machine Learning workflows on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) - on your laptop. Therefore, we use the [MiniKF](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/distributions/minikf/minikf-vagrant/) distribution provided by Arrikto.

## Software prerequisites

Duration: 0:10:00

Before installing MiniKF, you need to have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your laptop.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.

- [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

### VirtualBox

[Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) is a cross-platform virtualization application. It extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple OSes, inside multiple virtual machines, at the same time. As an example, you can run Windows and Linux on your Mac, run Windows Server 2016 on your Linux server, run Linux on your Windows PC, and so on, all alongside your existing applications. You can install and run as many virtual machines as you like. 

- [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

If you have **macOS**:  

After the installation, you need to [change Security & Privacy General preferences on Mac](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mh11784/mac) to unblock VirtualBox: 

- To change these preferences on your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General.

- If the lock at the bottom left of the pane is locked, click it to unlock the preference pane.

- Click allow to load system extensions from the developer of the software.
