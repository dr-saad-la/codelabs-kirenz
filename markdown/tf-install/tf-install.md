# Install TensorFlow


## Overview
Duration: 0:01:00

In this tutorial, we will install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

 
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Prerequisites

- To start this tutorial, I recommend to use [Anaconda](https://kirenz.github.io/python-basics/docs/programming-toolkit.html#anaconda).

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Create TensorFlow environment
Duration: 00:02:00

[Conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands
) help manage dependencies and isolate projects. This is particularly useful when some packages require specific Python versions (like TensorFlow).

On Windows open the Start menu and open an Anaconda Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux open a terminal window.

We create an environment with a specific version of Python (3.9). We call the environment ``tf``:

```bash
conda create -n tf python=3.9
```

When conda asks you to proceed ``(proceed ([y]/n)?``), type ``y``.


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Install TensorFlow
Duration: 00:02:00

First of all, you have to activate the `tf` environment:

```bash
conda activate tf
```

Upgrade pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Windows and Apple with Intel chips:

- Install TensorFlow

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Only for Apple chips: 

- Install the Tensorflow dependencies:

```bash
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
```

- Install base TensorFlow

```
pip install tensorflow-macos
```

- Install metal plugin:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-metal
```


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Install additional modules
Duration: 00:05:00

We install some additional modules:

```bash
pip install pandas 
```

```bash
pip install seaborn 
```

```bash
pip install jupyter 
```

```bash
pip install pydot 
```

We also need to install graphviz: see instructions at https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and learned how to install:

âœ… TensorFlow  

If you'd like to learn more about Deep Learning with TensorFlow, have a look at the following suggestion:

- [Deep Learning in Python with TensorFlow and Keras](https://kirenz.github.io/deep-learning/docs/intro.html)

If you want to switch back to your Anaconda base environment, just use:

```bash
conda deactivate
```
