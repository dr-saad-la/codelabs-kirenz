# Web Scraping in Python

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview

Duration: 0:05:00

### What we cover

In this tutorial we cover the basics of web scraping (also called web harvesting, or web data extraction) with Python to extract data from websites.

We will cover:

- Basics of HTML elements
- CSS Syntax
- CSS selectors and SelectorGadget
- Python libraries

*The content about HTML and CSS selesctors is based on Dmytro Perepolkin's ["Introduction to HTML elements"](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/harvesting-the-web.html)*

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Prerequisites

Duration: 0:01:00

To start this tutorial, you need:

- [Anaconda](https://kirenz.github.io/python-basics/docs/programming-toolkit.html#anaconda). 

- [Google Chrome Web-Browser](https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/chrome/)


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## HTML Elements 

Duration: 0:10:00

*The following content is based on Dmytro Perepolkin's ["Introduction to HTML elements"](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/harvesting-the-web.html)*

- HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". 

- A **HTML page** consists of a series of *elements* which browsers use to interpret how to display the content. 

- **HTML tags** are names of the *elements* surrounded by angle brackets like so: <tagname> content goes here... </tagname>. 
 
- Most HTML tags come in pairs and consist of opening and a closing tag, known as **start tag** and **end tag**, where the end tag name is preceded by the forward slash `/`.


- Below is a visualization of a simple HTML page structure:

- It is possible to define **HTML attributes** inside HTML tags. 

- **Attributes** provide additional information about HTML elements, such as   
  - hyperlinks for text, 
  - width and height for images


- Attributes are always defined in the start tag and come in name="value" pairs


<aside class="positive">
For example, The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination: 

<a href="https://www.example.com">  Here is my anchor text </a>
</aside>

*You can learn more about HTML tags and attributes from online resources, such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)*


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## CSS Syntax

Duration: 0:05:00

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

- It is the language we use to style an HTML document

- CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed


Watch this short video tutorial from the CSS Syntax chapter of the CSS tutorial on w3schools.com:

## CSS Selectors

Duration: 0:05:00

- CSS selectors represent patterns for locating HTML elements 

- They can be used not only for styling, but also for extracting the content of these elements

- **Selector Gadget** is an open source tool which allows CSS selector generation and discovery

<video id=52055686></video>

- Install the [SelectorGadget](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) extension in Google Chrome

- Lets have a look at the [quotes to scrape](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) and inspect the content of the page

- You can now use the extension (click at the magnifying glass symbol at the top right side of your Google Chrome browser) to inspect the site


*To learn more about CSS Selectors, review w3schools [CSS Selector Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)*
