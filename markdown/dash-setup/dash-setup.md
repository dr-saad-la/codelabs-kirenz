To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it. 

A common directory location for a virtual environment is `.venv`

This name keeps the directory typically hidden in your shell and thus out of the way while giving it a name that explains why the directory exists. It also prevents clashing with .env environment variable definition files that some tooling supports.

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env/dash-env
```

On Windows, run:

```bash
c:\>c:\Python3\python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
```

Running this command creates the target directory (creating any parent directories that donâ€™t exist already).

Activate the virtual environment using a shell-specific command:

```bash
source ./env/bin/activate 
```
source tutorial-env/bin/activate




```python
brew install go
```
